# AISearch
## by Tim Anthony Alexander

This is only a proof-of-concept and should not be used.

Start the search by running

`php search.php`

Then describe the file(s) you want to find.
Write "q" to exit the search.

After searching, you will have to wait a few seconds for the commands to run on your system.

#### Attention! This runs commands generated by chatgpt! No guarantee for safe behaviour at all!

### Examples:

`Search: All pptx files older than 6 months`

`Search: Php files in ~/aisearch with the name Search in them`
