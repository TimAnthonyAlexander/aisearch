# AISearch
Search through your computer (windows, macOS, or Linux) and find any file you need using ChatGPT.
You need an OpenAI API key to use this.

## by Tim Anthony Alexander

### Installation
Dependencies:
- PHP 8 or later
- Composer (getcomposer.org)
- Git
- OpenAI API key

Clone the repository and run `composer install` in the directory.
Run `php search.php` once, enter your operating system (mac, windows, linux) and do a dry-run by entering anything.
Nothing will happen as the config file will be generated.
In the config file there are three keys: 
- rules
- openai_api_key
- os

OS will be set to the operating system you entered before.
Rules should be set to this text, but you can modify it for better results:
`The user will be requesting either commands or a list of file names including the path. I want you to only return a valid json array of strings. Do not add any text outside of that json response as it is used further.`

After adding these details, running the search by doing `php search.php` should work.

This is only a proof-of-concept and should not be used.

Start the search by running

`php search.php`

Then describe the file(s) you want to find.
Write "q" to exit the search.

After searching, you will have to wait a few seconds for the commands to run on your system.

#### Attention! The commands are generated by CHATGPT. You are asked before running each command on your system, but there is no guarantee for them to be safe!

### Examples:

`Search: All pptx files older than 6 months`

`Search: Php files in ~/aisearch with the name Search in them`
